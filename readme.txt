This is the MATLAB code for the following paper:

Multiplicative Sparse Tensor Factorization for Multi-View Multi-Task Learning




Please run 'demo.m' to demostrate the training of vMSTF and MSTF on the synthetic data set .


Some functions about tensor calculations used in our code come from ''Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB'', which is a open source MATLAB tool. It can be download on http://www.tensortoolbox.org. We use Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB v3.2.1. Once you have downloaded or cloned the Tensor Toolbox, use ''addpath'' to add the tensor_toolbox directory to your path. Type ''help tensor_toolbox'' for a list of functions and classes provided by the toolbox.
